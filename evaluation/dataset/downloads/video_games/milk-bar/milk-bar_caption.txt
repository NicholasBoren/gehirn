Unfortunately, the string provided does not include the name of the original video game song. As an AI language model, I don't have access to external information and I cannot predict the content of the video without knowing the name of the song. 

To help you, as a reference, video games have become a vital part of the music industry, and many of their soundtracks are considered masterpieces on their own. Video game music composers are tasked with creating memorable and engaging musical pieces that set the tone for the gameplay experience. 

Some video games feature epic orchestral tracks that accompany cinematic cutscenes, while others use chiptune music, a genre that emerged during the early days of gaming, and relies on the sound chips of old gaming consoles. There are also games that use licensed music, making the soundtrack a mix of popular songs and game-exclusive tracks. 

Without knowing the specific game and it's musical style, it's impossible to write a rich, accurate, and informative description of the original video game song. Please provide more information if you have it.
