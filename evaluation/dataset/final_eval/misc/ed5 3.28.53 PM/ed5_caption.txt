As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to identify the YouTube video title of the piano cover of an anime song. Thus, I won't be able to provide a rich musical description of the original song. 

However, I can give you a general idea of what an anime song might sound like. Anime songs, also known as anison, are a genre of Japanese pop music used as opening or closing themes in anime series. These songs usually have a fast tempo, a catchy melody, and lyrics that reflect the anime's themes and characters. 

Anime songs vary in style and can range from upbeat, rock-inspired tracks to ballads with emotional vocals. The instrumentation often includes electronic keyboards, synthesizers, guitars, and drums, creating a dynamic and energetic sound. The use of vocal harmonies and choir arrangements is also common in some anime songs. 

Overall, anime songs are known for their ability to capture the essence of an anime and evoke emotions in the listener. They are an essential part of the anime viewing experience and have gained popularity outside of Japan as well. Whether it's a high-energy opening theme or a heartfelt ballad, anime songs have a unique sound that is instantly recognizable to fans.
