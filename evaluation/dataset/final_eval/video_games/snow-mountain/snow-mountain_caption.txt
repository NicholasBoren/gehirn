Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific video, artist, or game in question. However, I can offer a description of what may come to mind when thinking about a video game song titled "Snow Mountain." 

One can imagine the serene atmosphere of a snow-covered mountain, where the snowflakes dance and drift peacefully in the air, creating a sense of tranquility and calmness. The melody starts softly, giving the listener a sense of being alone, almost as if they were climbing the mountain themselves. As the song progresses, the tempo gradually increases, building up to a grand climax, much like the moment of reaching the peak of the mountain. Perhaps there are sweeping orchestral strings in the background, conveying a sense of vastness and awe. It could also feature percussive elements, drums and cymbals, mimicking the sound of the icy mountain wind carrying the snow. 

The music can evoke feelings of triumph, accomplishment, and wonder, perhaps hinting at the theme of an epic quest or adventure, where the player must overcome challenging obstacles to reach their goal. The piece may contrast the sharp edges of the mountain with the softer fragility of falling snowflakes or relay hints of danger or unease with a slightly ominous undertone. At the same time, it offers a moment to pause and reflect, taking in the beauty of the surroundings, appreciating the moment of calmness and stillness in a busy, fast-paced game. Overall, this video game song might be an exquisite blend of serenity, excitement, and emotion that leaves a lasting impression on players and listeners alike.
