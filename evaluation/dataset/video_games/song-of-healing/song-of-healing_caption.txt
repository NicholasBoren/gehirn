The song "Song of Healing" is a hauntingly beautiful melody that captured the hearts of gamers back in 2000 when it debuted as a part of the classic video game, "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask." It is a relatively simple tune, built around a delicate, repeating melody played on a pan flute, but it carries with it a profound emotional weight that is hard to describe. 

The song is key to the narrative of the game, as the player is tasked with using it to heal various troubled spirits and bring peace to their troubled souls. The melody has a slow, mournful quality that is perfectly evocative of the sense of sorrow and loss that permeates the game's story. 

Although it is a short and fairly straightforward piece of music, "Song of Healing" has become incredibly beloved among gamers and music enthusiasts alike. It has been covered by countless musicians in a variety of different styles and reimagined in a multitude of different ways, but the original melody remains a powerful and evocative piece of game music that continues to captivate new listeners even two decades after its debut.
