1. Collect channel URLs for each genre
2. Download videos and convert to MP3
3. Collect ground truths for 20+ songs
    - Collect time duration
4. Perform inference with MT3
    - Examine MIDI files (ones with sound and no-sound intros)
    - For electronic music, the videos scraped will not only just be the song 
    - For movie music, the ground truths are from a different source (timing will be different) so will involve manual editing
5. Figure out automated trimming
6. Perform evaluation
